The analysis of the Hotel Harmony dataset reveals critical patterns that directly influence booking demand, cancellation behavior, pricing decisions, and guest satisfaction. City Hotels attract more bookings due to location convenience, while Resort Hotels generate higher revenue per stay, especially during peak seasons. Seasonal trends show strong demand variations, emphasizing the need for dynamic pricing, seasonal promotions, and capacity planning.

Cancellation behavior is strongly driven by long lead times, booking changes, and low deposit types, highlighting that guests who book far in advance are more likely to cancel. Implementing partial payment or stricter cancellation policies for high-lead bookings can significantly reduce last-minute losses. The study also finds that the Average Daily Rate (ADR) fluctuates by season and guest composition, suggesting pricing optimization based on market segment and family-focused booking trends.

Furthermore, guests who request more special services generally show lower cancellation tendencies, indicating that customization improves commitment and satisfaction. Encouraging personalized services can therefore enhance loyalty and reduce booking churn.
